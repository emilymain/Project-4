####Idea Behind The Project
I would like to build a project where users can search out upcoming concerts in their area. I would also like for users to be able to post details about concerts/gigs they are having so artists without as much advertising power or who play smaller venues can spread the word about their shows.


#####Technologies I Plan on Using
* MEAN-Stack
* Mongo
* Express
* Angular
* Node   
* Mongoose
* Angular Material
* Git
* Github
* Heroku
* GoogleMaps API
* Jambase API
